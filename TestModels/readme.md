# Test model information.
Source models used to generate test data are provided in the export folder in .ply format.
Test contours and point clouds are stored in the "sampled" folder. Each subdirectory corresponds to different sampling rates. 

Point clouds are stored in .xyz format. Test contour stacks are stored in a single file. Slices are delimited by a newline, contours are delimited by ";" characters and each point in a contour is separated by space characters.
